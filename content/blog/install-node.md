## Installing Node.js

Go to the [Node.js installation page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and follow the instructions to download the LTS version.

Once the installation is complete you can check if both Node.js and NPM are installed by running these commands:

```bash
node -V
npm -V
```

## Update NPM to the latest version

If you want to update NPM to the latest version, you can run this command:

```bash
npm install -g npm@latest
```
